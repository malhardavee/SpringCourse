# 🌿 SpringCourse

This repository captures my structured and hands-on journey into backend development using the **Spring Framework** and **Spring Boot**.  
It includes concept-based examples, practice modules, and mini-projects that demonstrate my progress in building scalable, robust, and production-ready Java applications.

As part of this journey, I explore Spring’s core features such as **Dependency Injection (DI)**, **Inversion of Control (IoC)**, bean management, and component-driven architecture. Moving deeper into Spring Boot, this repository showcases my work in **REST API development**, **auto-configuration**, **layered architecture**, and **database integration** through Spring Data JPA.

This space reflects my commitment to writing clean, modular code and continuously growing as a backend engineer using industry-standard frameworks.
